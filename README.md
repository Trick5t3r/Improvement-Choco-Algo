# Improvement-Choco-Algo

**Additional scripts for further exploration of the choco-algos, including visualization, directed graphs, random matrices, and asynchronous processes.**

## Overview

This project provides two main algorithms for generating and exploring directed gossip graphs (**choco-algos**) over time, including synchronous and asynchronous versions. The scripts include tools for visualization and handling random matrices at each step.
